  <span style="font-size: large;">Intentions Can Provide Honest Justification</span>
</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">When there is no clue we can try to look at the intention. Intention seems to be more important then the action and its results. Love is not an action its an intention, a feeling, an honest example of love is a relationship between a mother and a child. A mother can be a good mother or poor mother in her duties towards child depending upon her eduction, background and several other factors but we cannot doubt the intentions of a mother. If she is healthy (physically/mentally) she will definitely work for the welfare of her child and any decision related to her child is backed by this intention.</span>

For example, we may apply for a job and even work to get the job while thinking that it is not possible for me to get this job. Maybe we tried to be realistic and thus avoid any negative feelings later. Our intentions play there role in our preparations, the way we face the interview and answer the questions. On most occasions we&#8217;ll find that the results were very close to what we had on our mind.</span>

<span style="font-size: large;"> </span><span style="font-size: large;">In the case mentioned above we can say that intentions depict our thinking. <em>A positive thinker will have a positive intention while a negative thinker will have a negative intention</em>. In fact it is true that when we have strong positive thinking our intentions also turn out to be positive, we do things whole whole-heartedly and not halfheartedly like in other cases and thus we command success every where, in every thing we do our express interest in.</span>  
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span><span style="font-size: large;">Positive thinking is not only good for our own self, our family but it is a feeling of community welfare, today we see so many books, posts and courses on positive thinking that only highlight how positive thinking can so many benefits to you, your career, your family, they do not take a down to earth community approach. They try to teach a selfish, materialistic way to <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/38/hypnosis-for-positive-thinking.htm" target="_self">develop positive thinking</a> or improving intentions positively.</span>  
<span style="font-size: large;"> </span><span style="font-size: large;"> </span>

<span style="font-size: large;">We must not forget that we are all part of the universe, a cosmos and whatever we do to it comes back to us. Even if we forget completely about our personal welfare and focus on the big picture alone, we&#8217;ll definitely improve our life, our career and everything we are trying to focus on with a narrow minded approach.</span>  
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span><span style="font-size: large;">Now if we still look at others and there intentions and what they are doing and then complain about it, then we are only expressing our own psyche, our negative thoughts (complains cannot originate from a positive thinker for reasons I can&#8217;t explain in words right here). This mentality is something we work on when we take classes in positive thinking, manifestation, hypnotism and other similar courses. </span>

> </h3>

<span style="font-size: large;"> </span><span style="font-size: large;">Intentions can be used to justify an action, a good intention will definitely deserve reward if the action and its reaction was pleasing or it can also be used to review a punishment which resulted from any action backed by a positive intention.</span>

<span style="font-size: large;">Intention is a mental process, a times it can even be isolated from action i.e., we may have a intention but never worked on it, never performed an action to fulfill it. Even then its judgmental, it can be used to pass a judgment, it can be used to conclude. A person interested in something right or wrong is somewhere supporting it. </span>  
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span><span style="font-size: large;">A positive thought or view is more likely to lead to a positive intention while a negative thought or view will give birth to a negative intention. The question is not only related to our personal well being, something which is the only priority today (and thus creating a negative environment globally). </span>  
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span><span style="font-size: large;">A simple way to improve life (slowly for results which will stay forever), is to develop positive thinking, try to see the positive side of everything. Don&#8217;t let negative emotions rule our mind, you don&#8217;t like something or someone then don&#8217;t think about hurting him/her instead think how to protect/save yourself from such negative interactions with the person or how to move ahead, progress (in whatever suitable way) so that such circumstances are left behind. </span>

Habit of positive or negative intentions do not develop or change in a day, they are a result of our past experiences and circumstances and how we reacted to them and its result. </span><span style="font-size: large;"> </span>

    Law of Attraction Justifies Power of Intentions
  </h3>
  
  <p style="font-size: large;">
    Now a days we are more interested in doing things that have benefits which are clearly defined (it is an effect of our modern lifestyle deeply influenced by marketing forces). These days there is new phrase which is gaining popularity "Law of Attraction", which states that we can achieve anything and everything if we start thinking about it, doing things associated with it, making it a part of our dream etc. etc. and therefore it is approving power of intentions in our life, we can rewarded or punished for our intentions, our thinking, our views as it is certain that if we are happy we&#8217;ll think about happiness while on the other hand if we are worried (due to any reason) we&#8217;ll definitely try to find a solution, which may include removing the cause or simply making arrangements for defense.

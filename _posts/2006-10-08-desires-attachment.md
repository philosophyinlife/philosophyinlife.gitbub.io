> Renounce desires as it is not from desiring that a thing is attained, rather it due to us from past deeds (*praarabh*). Desires lead to dependency and loss of equanimity. If we do not consider this body as ours, then there will be no desires. This is possible simply by accepting I (Self) as apart from the body. Thus become free from desires and attachment.

  Be Free of Desires and Attachment
</h2>

In the Gita, God has emphasized on the renunciation of desires. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">God, Saints and great Souls only tell us those things that we are able to do</span>. Some of our desires are fulfilled, and some remain unfulfilled. Rather the relationship between fulfillment of desire is not with desire itself, but with what is due to us (through *praarabdh*). That which we desire, we will have to accept dependency on that thing or person. Also due to desiring, we will not be able to remain equanimous in fulfillment or non-fulfillment of these desires.

The Self (*swarup*) has no desires, because it is naturally blissful (*sahaj sukhraashi*). Desires are due to considering this body as ours. We have no lordship or command over this body, then how can it be ours? This body did not remain as before, but we (Self) are the same as before. This body is continuously separating from us. The detachment with this body is possible simply by acceptance of the apart-ness. It is not through various practices, study, repetition and leanings (*abhyaas*).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">One who is unable to be free off desires and attachment, can never become a renunciate, an ascetic, detached from worldly objects</span>.

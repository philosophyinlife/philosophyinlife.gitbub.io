title: Honesty Is A Keyword
author: Yogesh Bailwal
excerpt: "Internet is a strange place, it contains words and keywords, they may or may not have any relation for example, 'honesty' may not actually mean 'honestly' its simply a word which has an attached market value and thus its use can bring that value that taste. It is not only with one word but its a whole dictionary for internet. Words no more convey there traditional meaning, they imply a new meaning, its just a part of philosophy on internet."

  <h2>
    Philosophy  & Honesty On Internet
  </h2>
</div>

> <div style="text-align: justify;">
>   <span style="font-size: large;">Honesty is a word which can be used and abused for a number of reasons, to be honest this word &#8220;<em>honesty</em>&#8221; is often misused on internet as a powerful keyword. A word which has accumulated lot of energy which can emotionally drag anyone to the contents where it is used on top, in headlines.</span>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">On most websites on internet which are influenced by psychological marketing words do not have any meaning attached to them, they are only a series of letters which have certain value (attached to them) like cheap, honest, best etc. These words are used as a supporting material which can help a marketing campaign succeed.</span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">Words are used as if they are lifeless objects which do not actually convey a meaning, an intention, they are mere like collection of characters which have different emotional value for the market. We can use any word (without looking at its meaning and whether we actually mean what it conveys) anywhere to get the desired results. We can use the word &#8216;<em>honest</em>&#8216; to add an element of authenticity. </span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The words are not actually misused by everyone as some people do understand there meaning in addition to its value and therefore also understand the risk associated in misusing this word by using it at a wrong place for a small one time profit</span>.</span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span></span></p> <h3 style="text-align: center;">
    Honesty Is Only A Keyword Today
  </h3>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">People who understand marketing and know how it works, often overlook words (for there attached meaning), they do not give any weight-age to traditional meaning of a word (I&#8217;ve to use &#8216;<em>traditional</em>&#8216; as our modern life today is insecure life, marketers have access to every nook and corner of our life and therefore we may not be aware that we are already under there influence and actually misunderstand words and there meaning or may be somehow support this (mis)use).</span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">Soon, more and more people will become blind to the words and there actual meaning and will try to understand the meaning based on its new context and thus words will have a new classification based on the theory of  marketers i.e. demand and supply, words which can be associated with a product or emotion will get new makeover frequently.<br /> </span>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: large;">Good will cease to be good and best will convey a new meaning, a pitch to sell something, this is <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/39/internet-and-philosophy.htm" target="_self">internet and its philosophy</a> which is more or less controlled by its e-commerce nature. Just like the word sex has been replaced (and conveys) porn and adult on internet, soon more words will also take a new shape a new form to convey a new meaning for <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/40/online-society-on-internet.htm" target="_self">society on internet</a>.</span>

Falgun Krishna Chaturthi, Vikram Samvat 2063, Mangalvar

*Detachment is taking place every moment and death is approaching us. Very soon the process of dying which started at birth will be completed*. Even though it may seem unpleasant, it is the Truth. Therefore give up your attachment and be [happy][1] ! Give up from the heart right now and attain [Supreme Bliss][2].

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
  Death A Certainty
</h2>

Death is approaching us. The day is bound to come, when we will have to give up all the things. Certainly we will have to detach from all beings and things that we have assumed to be ours. In fact, this detachment is taking place every moment. But this fact seems unpleasant. But even though it may seem unpleasant, it is the Truth.

This body too is dying every day and a day will come when people will say, He died today. Infact he did not die that day, but had started to die since birth. The only thing that happened that day, was that the process of dying was completed. Just like him, all that is born is going to die.

We should therefore give up their company from the heart, as they will not live with us forever. We should no insist that they live with us forever. Even if we desire that they live with us forever, they cannot do so. They will live only as long as they have to live. Therefore if we give up our attachment to whether they live or die, we will always be happy. We should accept the fact with a firm determination that [*death is certain*][3].

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is our experience each day that when the Sun rises we busily begin to work, and when it sets, it grow dark then we stop our activities and rest. No one weeps when this cycle happens</span>. Do they? However, when someone dies, we weep. What is the reason we do not weep when the Sun sets? It is because we know that the sun will set in the evening, therefore we complete all that is needful before the Sun sets, and we are not saddened by the setting of the Sun. Why do we not brood with the setting of the Sun? It is because we know that it was bound to happen.

> Whatever blooms will fade and perish. There is nothing new or different about death. The error is mostly in our knowledge about death. Know that death will come to all that is born. Therefore give them up from the heart, right now, and attain Supreme Bliss.

  About Sadhak Group
</h2>

*Sadhaka is a Yahoo Group which discusses Spirituality in Hinduism using texts and messages of Swami Ramsukhdasji.*

This group was founded on **Dec 28, 2003** and as on today it has **32334** active members, which is too low for such high class spiritual service, the main reason for such a low membership in Hindu Spiritual Group is due to the fact that it is not well promoted and most of its members are also delving deep in spirituality and therefore do not care about marketing and promotion of there message and group.

Now, its on us to do something for this group and make it accessible to all those who are a real seeker of spirituality and want to learn from the perception of Hinduism.

> It is really surprising to note that a number of books and study material are sold online and offline which may or may not have the real depth of true spiritual seekers, while this wonderful group is hiding behind the veils of modern materialistic world, where spirituality isn&#8217;t a mission of life but a subject, a book, a profession, a reason to divide humanity based on religious beliefs.

This group has been providing selfless services to those who are interested in [Hinduism and Hindu Spirituality][1].

Discussions are primarily based on Bhagavad Gita.

More books on Hindu Spirituality and Hinduism can be had from <a href="http://www.gitapress.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Gita Press, Gorakhpur</strong></a>.

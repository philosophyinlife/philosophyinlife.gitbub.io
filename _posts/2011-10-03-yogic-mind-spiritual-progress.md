Yogic mind in spiritual progress is a part of last post titled &#8220;Mental Purity & Three Fold Yoga&#8221;.

The next stage is the level of intellect where the power of discernment between what is right and what is wrong, is exercised. This includes the reasoning faculty and in general, the development of intellectual mind which imparts the right knowledge about the material world. This is the scientific mind that thinks rationally to filter truth from untruth in the phenomenal world, up to this level both science and spirituality share the common objective of knowing the truth unclouded by emotion and self interest. In spiritual terms, this is the gnosis or the Vijnana level where knowledge about the reality of material existence is obtained, upto this level one&#8217;s thoughts and actions are connected with the material world.  In terms of Yogic techniques, one could associate *Bhakti Yoga* with emotional purification while intellectual pursuits could be covered in the *Jnana Yoga*, both the processes of emotion and intellect purification involve an effort towards identification of the supreme reality of existence. The lead to the realization that material existence is not the ultimate reality.  There is a higher existence of intuitive life, that of universe mind and universe will, that is more creative, more powerful and free from the opposites and dualities of nature like pleasure and pain, good and bad, likeness and dislike etc., this life of spiritual intuition is blissful, beyond material limitations and always intuitively right in thought and action. In this life, one is in tune with *Prajna*, knowledge of cosmic existence and is always at peace with this knowledge. Here one is not affected by pettiness of material desires, limitations and restrictions of a conditioned mind, but enjoys the freedom of a universal life where personal desires are elevated to the universal will to do good to all. The transition from the intellect level to the pure intuitive level marks the change over from reasoning mind of materialism to complete surrender to the supreme power.

Normally, for a man of intellect, to do devotional surrender to God since he lacks the emotional back up to do so. But, if the intellect is used to know the infiniteness of absolute reality, and if the surrender is done out of respect for the vastly powerful entity, its infinite and eternal existence, the surrender is likely to be much more effective and everlasting. The knowledge brings all doubts to naught and gives a sense of insignificance to the individual in the vast universe. When a person with the knowledge of the reality surrenders, he becomes a true devotee. Such a person is the *Jnani Bhakta*, who is a devotee not because he is helpless and wants protection but he knows that this object of worship is truly infinite and eternal.

In the supramental existence, the operating laws relate to the unified whole rather that individual entities. The decision of good and bad, right and wrong, concerns the existence as a whole and not for any specific individual, group or subgroup of individuals. In a sense, it is the will of God that is supreme and not the rationality of the individual mind. Therefore, what happens intuitively is for the whole creation and is inherently for the betterment of every one. God is impartial to our preferences and dislikes because universal mind is, in its very nature, pure and uninfluenced by human ego. The whole exercise of spirituality is about merging our mind with the universal mind, for then we think as He thinks. The threefold Yogic Path (*Karma*, *Bhakti* and *Jnana*) brings this transition by making our mind move over from being body centric to emotion centric and then to intellect based discernment, with the knowledge acquired about the Reality, the mind sheds its materialism and surrenders to intuitive reality.

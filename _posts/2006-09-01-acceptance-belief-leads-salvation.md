> Faith, Belief and Acceptance from the Self (swayam, core being) are key in leading us to salvation. Once a devotee engages in God, his ignorance and lack of knowledge, is removed by God Himself. This ignorance is removed for even those that don&#8217;t believe in God, but have a keen inquiry into the Self. In reality, God is Ultimate Guru, because whoever receives knowledge, wisdom, enlightenment, he receives it all from only God.

  Acceptance and Belief within, Leads to Salvation
</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  If a person possibly meets a great Soul, a real Guru, and if he believes him to be a Guru (remover of ignorance), and has faith and belief in him and his words, then only will the person gain from this association. However if he himself from within (swayam) does not have faith and belief, then inspite of having a direct encounter with God Himself, he will not attain salvation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Lord Krishna gave discourses to Duryodhan, and tried to convince him to not engage in the war with the Pandavas, then too there was no affect on Duryodhan. The Lord Himself cannot do anything, when the person does not listen. The point is, it is only the acceptance by the Self (swayam), the belief within that leads to Salvation. Therefore Gita says, that it is by the Self that the Self has to be inspired, lifted up and realized. &#8220;<em>Uddhare daatmanaan</em>.. .. (Gita 6:5).
</p>

In Path of Knowledge (Jnana Yog), Gita addresses the worship of a Teacher (spiritual guide), but in Path of Action (Karma Yog) and Path of Devotion (Bhakt Yog), Gita does not indicate the need for a spiritual master. When feelings arise within, whereby a man is no longer satisfied by animalistic and inhuman selfish actions, and he desires to give up these selfish intents, selfish enjoyment of pleasures, at that point he becomes devoted to service of others (karma yogi). That **karma yogi on his own, attains Self-realization**. &#8220;*Tatasvayam yogsansidhah kaalenaatmani vindati*.&#8221; (Gita 4:37).

> That One, from whom we receive knowledge and wisdom, from whom a true path is revealed, from whom our duties in life become known, from whom our direction and aim in life becomes crystal clear, that is the Essence of a Guru (Guru tattva). That Guru tattva resides within each and everyone of us. That Guru tattva that reveals the Truth, whether it comes from an individual or scriptures etc., consider them to be your Guru.

There is this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one incomprehensible divine force, which is behind the smooth functioning of this entire universe</span>. When human beings develop faith in this divine force, at that point in time, they begin to walk the path towards God. Once a devotee engages in God, his ignorance and lack of knowledge, is removed by God Himself (Gita 10:11); and God Himself becomes the one to give salvation and whirl him out of the cycle of birth and death (Gita 12:8).

God has this unfathomable generosity, immense compassion that the one who does not believe in Him, the one who criticizes Him, one who is an atheist, even if in these individuals if there is a keen desire and inquisitiveness to know the inner Self, to gain spiritual knowledge, than with His blessings, they too attain this essential Knowledge and Wisdom.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">In reality, God is Ultimate Guru, because whoever receives knowledge, wisdom, enlightenment, he receives it from God only</span>. That knowledge wherever, and from whomever it is revealed, whether it be from a particular individual or from a particular scripture etc. that is considered the Guru (spiritual teacher), but at its very core, it is God Himself who is the Guru of all.

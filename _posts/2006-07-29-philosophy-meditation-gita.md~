<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abandoning all thoughts of the world, be a witness and become still (repose). Neither oppose a thought, nor support it. Do not accept affinity with any thoughts. Neither have attachment, nor aversion for these thoughts</span>.

A spiritual aspirant should accept affinity with only the all pervasive God, who is everywhere, at all times, in all persons, in all things, in all incidents, and in all actions. Accepting this, one should remain established in Him, without thinking of anything else.

  Meditation
</h2>

If we have an exclusive aim to attain only God, our mind will automatically remain established in God. Space is around and envelops us from all directions, so it is with God, but we do not pay attention to this.

Therefore *abandoning all thoughts of the world, be a witness and become still*(repose) . While remaining established in God, do not oppose any thought that comes to mind.

A spiritual aspirant neither opposes a thought, nor supports it. He only remains a witness to it and attains tranquility and quietude.

> All projections and distractions of the mind are transient, so if these are born, they will certainly come to an end. We should not accept our affinity with them. We should accept our affinity with only God who pervades everywhere.

Moreover, when a [spiritual aspirant meditates upon God][1], memories of past incidents come to his mind. These incidents are not there in the present (non-existent) . But a spiritual aspirant by accepting the existence of those past incidents, strengthens them.

Therefore the spiritual aspirant should remain detached from them . Become a witness to them. He should neither have attachment nor aversion for them.

While discharging duties and performing actions, he should accept that God is all pervading, within and without and indivisible. It will help us in meditating on God. Whether one meditates in seclusion or does work in society, a [spiritual aspirant][2] should always accept that God pervades everywhere, at all times, in all persons, in all things, in all incidents, and in all actions. Accepting this, one should remain established in Him, without thinking of anything else.

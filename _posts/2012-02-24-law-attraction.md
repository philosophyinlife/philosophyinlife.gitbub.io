## Philosophy Behind Law of Attraction

Today our environment, lifestyle and surrounding is reflected in how we are today interpreting laws of nature, we are looking for shortcuts and easy ways to fulfill our artificial needs and desires, we are not actually willing to understand and work on basics, we simply want to apply those advanced natural laws to get results fast.

It is true that nothing is impossible, but it is also a fact that everything isn&#8217;t possible. Today we are trying to do things which will not solve our problem, they will simply add more problems to our life. We are trying to use natural laws to fulfill our selfish desires, we are getting motivated for wrong reasons, which will not result in any [real happiness][1] or transformation except making us more greedy and selfish.

### What is Law of Attraction?

[Law of attraction][2] states that we get what is on our mind. Our thoughts make up our mind and things that exist there, also appear in real world in near future. So, in order to get things that we appreciate in real world we must start thinking about it, start concentrating on them.

*According to law of attraction, our dreams, imaginations, views turn to reality, our present situation, circumstances are a result of what we have been talking about, thinking in our mind, doing in our life*. When we make a image in our mind and then preserve it using our actions, its likely to be realized in real world. It is like saying imaginations leads to realization.

### Positive Thinking Vs Law of Attraction

[Positive or negative thinking][3] is actually what works behind the principle of law of attraction, our positive views in life help us to achieve higher goals while negative views create problem and obstacles in every sphere of our life. Thinking in right direction has always helped everyone.

We cannot [develop positive thinking][4] by simply looking at its benefits and trying to adopt it to get some results in our life. Thoughts and views cannot be altered or modified to fulfill our dreams or to satisfy our personal desires and we think we are able to do so or if we are aware and still use some shortcuts to modify our thoughts or views artificially then what we get isn&#8217;t a positive view or positive thought its an outcome of a negative mentality and thus a negative thought or view, which means that even if we are somehow able to manage the outcome or results, we won&#8217;t be able to get the ultimate results, the true happiness as either positive thinking or law or attraction isn&#8217;t about material gains (although they are achieved as a byproduct), reaching our personal goals, its more then that.

### Honesty Vs Positive Thinking Vs Law of Attraction

[Honesty is a real path to develop positive thinking][5], to achieve results that are today listed under law of attraction. Today we are more or less influenced by market and marketing forces we are so much under there influence that we try to think in terms of pros and cons, benefits and advantages.

If I tell you that whether its positive thinking or law of attraction or [hypnotism][6], we can find each one of them, get benefits of each of them by simply trying to be honest to ourself and our surrounding. I know that we are today so much influenced by negative thoughts that honesty seems to be something which is impossible to follow in modern world, which is in fact wrong and a negative approach of negative thoughts.

Honesty isn&#8217;t a difficult thing to follow, its one of the easiest tasks to achieve, where you don&#8217;t have to process anything in your mind (in terms of computer science its like an output device, a monitor which simply displays everything that is typed, keyed in via the keyboard, there is no processing or CPU usage).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If we think it is not possible for us to even try to be honesty as it is sure to result in some bad experiences, then how can we develop positive thinking</span> (when we find it difficult to be truthful) and if we are not able to develop a positive attitude, do you think we can get results from law of attraction. Goals which are only limited to our personal welfare will have similar results, goals which are limited to family welfare will show similar results, goals with a broader perspective will have similar results. It is important for each one of us to find success in our life, to reach ideal conditions to fulfill our personal philosophy of life but why should we adopt a path which is materialistic, cumbersome when we have get better results by following a positive, honest way which will not only insure our personal well being but also consider our environment, our surrounding, our planet.

### Philosophy of Manifestation Vs Law of Attraction

Today both terms [philosophy of manifestation][7] as well as law of attraction are used to convey the same message, that there is a secret, an alternative approach to find success in life, to get better results in life, without actually explaining the basics of these laws on which the nature works.

Trying to fulfill wild desires without actually attaching it to a social cause can never result in real satisfaction (true happiness). It is true that we can change our life by simply changing our views, our beliefs, our thoughts and it takes time to change them, it requires lot of patience and hard work.

> We cannot change our self easily as we are not living in isolation, most of our time is spend in environment which is not conducive to such thoughts, we watch tv, movies, browse web, work in an office, talk to our friends and all these things push and pull our views, our thoughts and if we really want to make them positive, try things discussed about power of manifestation or law of attraction then we must first learn the tricks which can help us to keep our mind isolated from negative views and thoughts as and when we confront them (its like developing an immunity system, and most great saints, yogis master this only after years of practice).

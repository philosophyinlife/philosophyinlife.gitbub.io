    <span style="font-size: 130%;">Mind is a privilege of Living Beings, its an indication of liveliness. It helps us to grasp our surrounding with the help of our senses. Whatever we perceive or understand is outcome of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 130%;">an illusion which is created by our mind</span><span style="font-size: 130%;">. Each one of us expresses every circumstance, situation differently, even if we see the same picture we&#8217;ll notice different views.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">Life and nature behaves somewhat similar with each one of us, still it may not carry the same meaning for each one of us. We can notice different reactions and reporting on an incident in TV, newspapers and blogs, although they are all reported by professional journalists.</span>

  <h3>
    Life Is A Illusion
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"><a title="Life An Illusion of Mind" href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/10/life-an-illusion-of-mind.htm">Life is an illusion</a>, there is no unanimous conclusion on life, our views, thoughts, experiences, education, circumstances all effect our definition of life. It can be a place to enjoy a happy life or place where you have to struggle every day.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">We cannot anyone for anything, but there is surely a way to improve this picture of life, give it more vibrant colors, make it an interesting journey. All this can be achieved easily without even taking the help of any external source with positive views, thinking in right direction.<br /> </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Data provided by our senses is manipulated by our mind according to his own philosophy or attitude. Even senses work under his guidelines, they work in confidence of mind. Eyes see what mind has instructed it to see, if eves have been instructed not to see an object or such an object doesn&#8217;t exist at all for us to see, then eyes will simply refuse to find it around as if nothing as such exists before it.
  </p>

    <p>
      Spirituality, faith and <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/255/philosophy-positive-thinking.htm" target="_self">positive thinking</a> are ways to mend problems associated with mind. Once our mind learns these techniques its state of illusion is eliminated immediately. This world becomes a beautiful place to be around. Life seems good and happier than ever before, with all the games of life leading to a positive experience. Eyes too start seeing a new ray of light in every object it comes across.

  <h2>
    Powerful Mind is Responsible for Virtual Reality
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Mind is very powerful so is the illusion created by mind. it may make you think & grasp things in a way which isn&#8217;t true. Something that no one else will agree except the one who has got his mind in illusion. Illusion created by mind can make you believe in something that doesn&#8217;t exists at all. This is something that scientist know as &#8216;<em>Virtual Reality</em>&#8216;. Virtual reality isn&#8217;t anything other than an illusion created by mind.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 130%;">This virtual reality or illusion of mind</span><span style="font-size: 130%;"> can exist in one of the two forms. We can think in any direction as per our perception or illusion created by mind. We can think or believe that what others are calling a &#8216;virtual reality&#8217; or &#8216;illusion of mind&#8217; is in fact a fact and not a myth or illusion of mind. We may also feel that what others think to be real is actually a myth a virtual image of objects, which actually aren&#8217;t existing but are simply there because of mass illusion existing among people.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If a survey is conducted on the above question of virtual reality and illusion of mind on an issue or object, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll get answer in favor of each of the concepts i.e. for some people an object or issue is real and for others its virtual or distraction. This is because &#8216;<em>Life An Illusion of Mind</em>&#8216; or &#8216;virtual reality&#8217; aren&#8217;t a <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/" target="_self">concept or philosophy of life</a> but a reality, a truth which exists with the life on this planet.

## Natural Law of Nature Prevails Everywhere

Nature holds answers to a number of our questions, it even provides answer to our query what is the [*meaning of life*][1].

We do not need the help of any book or tutorial or anyone else as they will only deviate our attention from the real answer/solution, which is lying before. Most theories and concepts will not help right now to understand life and its meaning, we have to conceive this our self directly from the nature, our surrounding, present and past, once we have developed our own convincing view we can extend this knowledge, refine it further with additional material, other sources.

We can start looking at nature&#8217;s reply to this question anywhere, anytime as nature pervades every thing, it exists every where. Even when we try to keep nature at bay with our so called intelligent artificial creations, nature presents itself in the most suitable form for that environment.

You must have noticed bed bugs, termite, cockroaches etc. in modern scientifically designed apartments, which are designed by keeping comfort in mind, easing life, eliminating common problems that are usually found in a resident. Yet, even after taking all the precautionary measures, we find that they can only stop nature from implementing its laws for some time, they do not have a permanent solution and even if they law of nature will reappear there in another form.

We may try hard to wipe out law of nature, take services from the experts in these fields but none of them can provide a life time solution, they only have a temporary solution which has to be applied again and again after some time. It is very difficult if not impossible to isolate nature and its natural processes.

  Learning Meaning of Life from Plants
</h2>

We can try to understand meaning of life from plants around us. We can *start watching any plant, a shrub or even tree, try to find a purpose/meaning of its life, what are its requirements, how does it react to problems, what are its basic necessities, is it happy with what it has, satisfied with its present circumstances*.

We&#8217;ll notice that plants actually live a life, they enjoy there survival with the nature. They are healthy, fit for performing there every task that is expected from them with whatever resources they have, in prevailing circumstances and conditions.

There greenery, beauty is an indication of there health, well being, happiness. They do what they ought to do, perform there every duty and later give way for others to survive.

### What is the meaning of life for them?

In one word we can say it is to protect and preserve nature and life, help nature to help life, it takes from and gives to the nature, makes it possible for others to survive naturally, without any artificial support, produces more of its own kind to make it possible that at least some of its species carry on this task of nature in future.

This is all that is meant to be achieved and is actually achieved in there life cycle. Just like human beings these plants too show reaction when they are treated harshly, there is a question of there survival, when they are unable to fulfill there basic need required to perform there tasks or duties. In such condition we can notice some uncommon/unnatural behavior.

### Imitating Characteristics of Nature to Stay Focused in Life

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-495" title="Natural Meaning of Life" src="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/natural-meaning-life.jpg" alt="Learning Meaning of Life from Plants and Nature" width="252" height="484" />As a human being we too try to imitate the characteristics of nature, using other means some of which are natural and thus helpful while others are artificial and thus harmful. Some people move towards spirituality, they take some time to meditate, which helps one to concentrate on there main task, helps to close mind to unwanted distractions, helps to focus on natural goals of life and thus helps in enjoying happiness in current circumstances.

Some people who look for a quick fix start using unnatural means like drinking, entertaining themselves using modern ways which do not help to stay focused or calm in reality, they only help one to occupy his brain with something else which looks soothing at that moment, but when its effects are gone, a person returns back, the situation reappears in its original form.

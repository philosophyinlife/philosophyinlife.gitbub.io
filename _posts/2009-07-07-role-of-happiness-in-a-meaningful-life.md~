<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Every form of life on this planet is meaningful</span>. Even if we don&#8217;t consider ourselves as an important part of this planet/universe, the environment that we live in, that supports our lives, this fact (whether we are important part or not) remains unperturbed. </span>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: 130%;">Whether we consider ourselves to be very important or not important at all, things remain as they are. Just like an ocean filled with water, which is nothing but drops of water containing other minerals. Each drop of water in the ocean has some role to play and they are playing there role in there community called ocean. Each of them has characteristic similar to the ocean or we can say that ocean has characteristic similar to each drop of water it contains. If there is no water there is no ocean, and if there are no drops, there is no water.</span>

  <h2>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"><strong>Meaning of Life</strong></span>
  </h2>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">Meaning of life for each one of us depends on the role we play in our life, in our family, in our society, at work. Even if we are not aware of our role we are still playing it, there is still a meaning of our life. Sometimes we are not aware of this meaning, our role; but our family, our society knows that and often makes us realize this. That is why we often get offended or excited on hearing there remarks that reaches us occasionally. </span>
  </p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: 130%;">Life doesn&#8217;t attach a good or bad tag to anyone of us, as life is a creation of nature which is abundant and needs each one of us for one purpose or another. Good or bad are reactions bound to circumstances and situations. The judgment of good or bad also depends on several other factors. So, nobody has a right to say that he/she (for them self) is bad, as every behavior is guided by the surrounding atmosphere which culminates into our nature/behavior.

  <h3>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"><strong>Role of Happiness</strong></span>
  </h3>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">Happiness is an indication of our level of satisfaction with our role in life (more in <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/9/satisfaction-an-open-secret-to-happiness-in-life.htm" target="_self">satisfaction an open secret to happiness</a>). It also indicates our level of involvement in our role (our duties). If we are happy we are actually doing our work whole heartedly, if we are unhappy then definitely we are not involved in our work (physically or mentally) whole heartedly or at all. An unhappy state of mind isn&#8217;t just bad for a person, a single role or job, it effects every sphere of our life and of our surrounding in a positive or negative way. </span>
  </p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="font-size: 130%;">A meaningful life is definitely a life which consists of happiness. Choice to be happy isn&#8217;t always a result of some external factor, it is more or less an individual choice. If I want to be happy I can be happy as now I see things in a different light for example I think of present circumstances, situations as &#8216;<em>What we get is what we pay for</em>&#8216; or an appropriate reaction to our actions or deeds (as every action is said to have an equal and opposite reaction). </span>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: 130%;">If I want to be unhappy then I can try any of the many excuses lying around (by the way an unhappy person isn&#8217;t completely immersed in his/her duties/role and has therefore enough time to collect such excuses from different sources).</span>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">Human life isn&#8217;t anything but a biological cycle, we are all passing from one stage to another stage, whether we think our life as a <a title="Role of Happiness in A Meaningful Life?" href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/role-of-happiness-in-a-meaningful-life/">meaningful life surrounded with happiness</a> and happy people or we take our life as rubbish, unworthy of living, useless. Time is ticking and so is the life, our show is going on, we are already playing our role (of a happy or &#8230; person).</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">Life is a period of time, a collection of moments and its is up to us to waste these precious moments without enjoying them and being happy or be involved at every step in our work, with our role and improve our actions so as to attract better reactions. It is better to start playing a role which we consider to be a positive role for our family, our society and this planet instead of worrying and blaming something or someone.</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: 130%;">We are all responsible for what happens to us, our life, our family and our planet and happiness in our heart, in our work, in our role can only make things better for all of us. <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/life-is-simple-and-easy-enjoy-life/" target="_self">Life is simple, enjoy</a>. </span>

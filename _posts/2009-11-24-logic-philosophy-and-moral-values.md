<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;">Is philosophy is a logical interpretation of moral values or is it an interconnection of moral and logic, combining moral values with logic or we can say that philosophy is a logical conclusion of moral values. Philosophy without moral is a vehicle without engine to drive, <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/23/logic-and-philosophy.htm" target="_self">logic behind the philosophy</a> is the fuel which drives it in motion.</span>

## Philosophy A Logical Interpretation of Moral Values

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;">In today&#8217;s environment where <em>moral value and philosophy</em> is looked down as being old fashioned, unscientific theories which do not have any place in today&#8217;s fast paced societies. This is what most of us who lead a busy life in modern comfortable world think, the actual people who form this society at large. </span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;">In this article <em>&#8216;Logical Philosophy of Moral Values&#8217;</em> I&#8217;m not talking to libraries, universities, students of philosophy and a few intellectuals who already know more than what I ever think of knowing, for them philosophy is still a contemporary subject of there lives, they live with this philosophy as a subject and object, but they actually form a fraction of society who only have to play a role on some occasions and incidents, by and large they are sleeping part of society which are neglected and ignored by modern trends in today&#8217;s society. Here I&#8217;m talking to all active members of society at large, those who have lost logical sense of philosophy and moral values.Â  Here, I&#8217;m expressing my views on logic, moral values and philosophy concerning a common man, affecting each common trend in society which effects us, the common man who still forms a major part of society even today.</span>
</div>

> <div>
>   <span style="font-size: large;">A common man may not be concerned with philosophical logic for moral values because it isn&#8217;t directly linked with success today. This doesn&#8217;t mean that these philosophical theories and there logic for moral values have ceased to exist or they&#8217;ve stopped working for them due to pollution and degrading environment. </span>
> </div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;">No, it isn&#8217;t so, these principles and theories are very much there and are still working the way they actual do for centuries. If we are ignorant or unaware of its existence because we are preoccupied with complexities we have created for ourselves in the name of advanced technology and advanced society with latest scientific discoveries, then we are at fault. </span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;">The <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/24/can-philosophy-exist-without-logic.htm" target="_self">logic, philosophy and moral values</a> are actively playing there role in our lives, awareness of there existence and effectiveness will only make many things in our life easy to understand. It will reduce the web of complexity, in which we are trapped to some extent. Unawareness and ignorance of something which exists and is live can lead to unintentional accidents.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Morals and moral values are basic building blocks of everything live and surviving on this planet</strong>. It is a foundation of everlasting health, wealth and <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/35/happiness-is-a-decision.htm" target="_self">happiness in our life</a> Logic on other hand is a tool which helps us to implement things in our life, if there is no logic in something then we find that thing difficult to implement. </span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;"><em>Things which have some logical value attached to them create a sense of urgency in our mind and we are inclined to adopt them without any further delay</em>. Moral values on the other hand are practically very important but may not always make a logical sense to us. This lack of logical sense makes it difficult and inconvenient for us to implement them, because now our mind isn&#8217;t providing a sense of urgency as it can&#8217;t find any reason to do so. So, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">moral values without logic may look good to us but we have a poor record of implementing them</span>.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span>
</div>

> <div>
>   <span style="font-size: large;"><em>Philosophy is a scientific art which adds the element of logic to moral values</em>. Philosophy has the freshness of moral values and nutrition of logic for our mind, which makes philosophy a natural organic food which is easy to digest. So, we can say that philosophy is a logical interpretation of moral values.</span>

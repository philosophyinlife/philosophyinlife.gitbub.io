  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">Love and lust are easily interchanged these days. Normally most of use cannot even see or find any major difference between the two. Common thinking is that love is followed by lust or lust is followed by love or both of them mean one and the same thing except the fact that one (love) is a polite way to express another (lust).</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">Anyway, what is to follow is a post that I found on Sadhak Group at Yahoo (which means I am just a medium and not the source). I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy reading this post on <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/27/philosophy-of-love-vs-lust.htm" target="_self">Philosophy of Love Versus Philosophy of Lust</a>.</span>

  <span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Love versus Lust</span></span>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"><em>Worldly people due to their ignorance, do not understand the true nature of Love</em>. They regard lust to be the same as Love. Lust is seen in most beings, especially more so in evil people, devils, demons, fiends, animals etc. Only the liberated Souls are capable of true Love.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 1. In lust both parties want to receive something from the other, while in Love, a devotee (lover) wants to offer everything to the Lord (Beloved).</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 2. In lust a person wants to satisfy his senses, while in Love he wants to serve the Lord (beloved), without any desire for personal gain (without wanting anything in return).</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lust is physical, while Love is spiritual</span>, it is divine.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 4. Lust involves delusion and pain, while Love is totally free from delusion and pain, and involves emancipation and infinite bliss.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 5. In lust there is attachment and dependence, while in Love there is</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 130%;"> relinquishment and independence.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 6. <strong>Lust is selfish, while Love is selfless</strong>.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 7. One who is lustful, becomes a slave to the object of lust, while Bhagwaan Himself becomes a slave to a devotee that is capable of Love.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 8. Lust changes into insipidity, while love enhances every moment,</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 130%;"> intensifying into a blissful state.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 9. Lust is born of need, i.e. out of something lacking, while Love sprouts from completeness and the lover (devotee) remains happy in the happiness of the beloved (God).</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 10. In lust there is desire to derive pleasure, while in Love a lover</span><br /> <span style="font-size: 130%;"> (devotee) wants to please the Beloved (Bhagwaan, Lord).</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 11. Lust leads to hell, while Love leads to the abode of God (the Beloved).</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"> 12. In lust, the parties involved ever remain two, while in Love, the lover (devotee) and the Beloved (Lord) become one and the same.</span>
  </p>

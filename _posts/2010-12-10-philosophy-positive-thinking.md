## What is Positive Thinking or Optimism?

Positive thinking or optimism is an art of looking at things with a bright prospective, discovering light in darkness, seeing beauty in ugliness. Every thing that exists in nature has two sides, two opposite directions and those who always look at the one which supports life, nature and creativity are known as optimistic or positive thinkers.

In our day to day life we always have some choices before us like to do or not to do, is it possible or impossible, things are good or bad. Most of these choices depend on our own confidence level, our individual perspective on how we look at things, our mood, our present circumstances (which are temporary).

Whenever someone finds himself/herself in a difficult situation a positive thinker or optimist will start looking for solution, without worrying about the problem, its size and consequence that can be faced if it is not solved. On the other hand a negative thinker or pessimist will look and think about the problem, will even try to find some guaranteed solution (which are hardly available) and will start worrying.

## Positive and Negative Thoughts Co-exist

<img class="size-full wp-image-262 alignleft" style="margin: 5px;" title="positive-negative-thoughts" src="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/positive-negative-thoughts.jpg" alt="Positive Thoughts & Negative Thoughts Co-exist" width="138" height="125" />Our mind is always able to draw a positive or negative picture of everything that it comes across as *both positive as well as negative thoughts co-exist in our mind*. The moment we gain confidence our thoughts and action show sign of positivism and the moment we loose confidence or control, feel depressed our mind gets filled with negative thoughts.

We can our-self see and feel the phenomena of painting same circumstance in positive and negative hue by our mind in everyday life. Sometimes when we are down and feeling low we will see that our life is filled with difficulties and there seems to be no way out, after a couple of days when we are more energetic, filled with enthusiasm the same conditions and circumstances will look good and promising.

## Improving Our Vision and Thoughts for Success in Life

We can improve the way we visualize things and the way we think and tag things. This is not an automated process which can be initiated by watching some videos or listening to some audios or by simply reading an ebook or undergoing some course in <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/38/hypnosis-for-positive-thinking.htm" target="_self"><em>personality development and positive thinking</em></a>. I don&#8217;t thing that such activities will help everyone or even most of us who really need to change our perspective and thoughts. Such commercial products do help to learn and understand the philosophy behind our thoughts, how positive and negative thinking effect our lives, benefits of positive thoughts in our life etc. They will also help those who have already completed there home work i.e., they are already on the path and have already <span style="text-decoration: underline;">spend some time in intro-inspection and understanding there strengths and weaknesses and how they have effected there lives</span>.

Improving thoughts and drawing a positive conclusion in every circumstance is only possible if are willing to work on it, are keen to improve our self for the welfare of our family, society and nature. Learning something from a selfish motive isn&#8217;t positive thinking and isn&#8217;t the right way of trying to develop positive thinking, its just like trying to misuse our natural powers. Doing good things, things welfare of our family, neighbor, society and nature are positive approaches. Look at Sun and sunshine which is the only source of power, light, life and everything on this planet. It provides energy to every part of this planet without any prejudice. This is a natural approach and therefore positive approach and when we develop the intelligence to understand all these things, we automatically start developing positive thinking, our mind starts looking for solution without getting perturbed by the size of the problem.

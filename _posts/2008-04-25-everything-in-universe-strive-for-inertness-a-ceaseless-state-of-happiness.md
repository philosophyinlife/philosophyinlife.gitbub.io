      <span style="font-size: 130%;">Happiness is something we all strive to get, we are not alone in our endeavor to search for happiness. This whole universe, all forms of living and non living things in this universe strive for it. This is in fact a scientific universal truth.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span style="font-size: 130%;">Some of us may think of this happiness in other words, some of us may misunderstand this happiness in the form of an objective, a desire, a plan. Actually all the things we do, all objectives in our life, all objectives in our day have a propensity towards this happiness , the <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/15/philosophy-of-eternal-blissfulness-a-ceaseless-state-ii.htm" target="_self">ETERNAL BLISS.</a></span>

    <p>
      <span style="font-size: 130%;">Even scientists will agree to the fact that all the atoms are always constantly trying to acquire an inert configuration. Inertness is said to be a stable state. All the forms of actions and reactions that take place regarding atoms is actually an endeavor to get that inertness. So, we see all these things happening around us, all the chemical industries on this globe are taking advantage from this inclination of atoms.</span>

    <p>
      <span style="font-size: 130%;">Now look at us, we the humans we <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/philosophy-of-happiness-2/" target="_self">think of happiness</a> as a cheap commodity (like </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">s</span><span style="font-size: 130%;">atisfaction</span> &#8216;<em><span style="font-size: 130%;">santosh</span></em><span style="font-size: 130%;">&#8216; ) </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">which </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">is </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">easily </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">available </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">just </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">like </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">air </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">and </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">water</span><span style="font-size: 130%;">. Which o</span><span style="font-size: 130%;">ne</span><span style="font-size: 130%;"> can </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">easily </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">get </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">as</span><span style="font-size: 130%;"> and</span><span style="font-size: 130%;"> when he desires</span>. <span style="font-size: 130%;">We</span><span style="font-size: 130%;"> seldom </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">understand </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">that </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">even</span><span style="font-size: 130%;"> though </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">happiness </span><span style="font-size: 130%;">and</span><span style="font-size: 130%;"> s</span><span style="font-size: 130%;">atisfaction seem to be much closer and within our reach it isn&#8217;t such an easy game to win. It requires a lot of practice and understanding. We like to reach it through another subconscious path, where one aims material goods one after the another (because subconsciously we thinks it will bring us close to success, bring more things in life, help him in <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/9/satisfaction-an-open-secret-to-happiness-in-life.htm" target="_self">leading a satisfied and content life</a>).</span>

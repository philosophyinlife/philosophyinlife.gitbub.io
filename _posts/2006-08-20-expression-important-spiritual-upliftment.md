  Inner Expression is Most Important in Spiritual Upliftment
</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  &#8220;<em>Yah Saastravidhimutsrjy a vartate kaamakaaratah</em><br /> <em> na sa siddhimavaapnoti na sukham na paraam gatim</em>.&#8221; (Gita 16:23)
</p>

&#8220;He who having cast aside the ordinances of scriptures, acts in an arbitary way, according to his sweet will, attains, neither perfection, (purity of inner sense) nor happiness, nor achieve the Supreme Goal. (Gita 16:23)&#8221;

### &#8220;Yah Saastravidhimutsrjy a vartate&#8221;

Here God is talking about the people who perform actions such as sacrifice, offer charity and do good to all others according to their own unrestrained self-will, in an arbitrary way, disobeying the ordinances of scriptures. These individuals attach importance only to the seemingly outward good activities, and do not bother to get rid of their inner evil tendencies such as desires, anger and greed. Even other people see and give importance to only the outwardly actions and behavior. Individuals who truly understand and know the inner expressions, intentions, righteousness, integrity of another individual are very few. But in reality the inner intentions and expressions are most important.

People with demoniac tendencies have evil feelings within, but project themselves to be great ascetics and sacrificers on the outside. Being proud of their outward good actions, they punish and scold others. It is because of their bodily pride that their virtues are transformed into evil, their glory into blame, and their renunciation into attachment and pleasure which lead them to their downfall and ruin. Due to the internal evil propensities, they sacrifice the scriptural teachings and they act in a arbitrary way, according to their own sweet will.

> A patient plans to avoid unhealthy diet, and intends to take a wholesome meal. But out of attachment, eats things that worsen his disease. Similarly, these people from their own view-point, attempt to do good actions, but evils such as desire, greed, anger take them under their sway and they act in an arbitrary way, disregarding the ordinance of the scriptures and are thus damned.

### &#8220;Na sa siddhimavaapnoti&#8221;

Those possessing demoniac nature, perform supposedly good actions, such as religious sacrifice etc., casting aside the ordinance of scriptures. Thus they may attain benefits like wealth and honour etc, but they do not attain perfection in the form of purity of heart.

### &#8220;Na sukham&#8221;

They do not attain Saattvika happiness because in their hearts the burning feeling of desire and anger etc persists. They may derive pleasure, born of contact with objects, which are only sources of sorrow (Gita 5:22)

### &#8220;Na paraam gatim&#8221;

They do not attain the Supreme Goal, because firstly they do not believe in it. Moreover, actions performed out of desire, anger, and greed are not conducive to attainment of the Supreme Goal.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Even though the actions they perform are good, but due to evil propensities such as desire (Lust), greed, anger and pride, which are stumbling blocks, they are unable to attain perfection, the Supreme Goal</span>.

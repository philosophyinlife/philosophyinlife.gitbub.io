<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">Nature not only protects every form of life but it also bestows the right to survive. We humans are humans and cannot think or act like nature we can only try imitating the nature as per our understanding.</span>
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /> Everything Has A Right to Survive</span>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /> May be we have forgot this message of the nature but environment problems, shrinking ozone layer, economic recession, ecological balance are all a clear indication that nature is not supporting our actions and in order to survive we must make some changes and improvements in our lifestyle.<br /> </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /> What we think or know may not be correct? All our theories of life and happiness are based on our on interpretation of law of nature, we increased production using artificial techniques, we tried to add taste using artificial flavors, self life using preservatives. Now we are struggling with health problems, some dreaded disease.<br /> </span>
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /> We Cannot Escape from Nature</span>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /> Some of us think that they can stay away from natural surrounding (that they have created) and protect themselves from its negative consequence. Well, it is not feasible, a man cannot survive in artificial environment, an environment which is surrounded by non-living things like air conditioner, water purifier, electronic communicator etc.<br /> </span><br /> <span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /> If we are living thing then its our natural tendency to enjoy natural surrounding. Artificial objects and surroundings are only non-living and suitable to store non-living things. If a living things is stored there (stays there) he/she is likely to develop some problem because its not his nature.<br /> </span>
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /> Enjoy the Right to Survive and Enjoy Life<br /> </span>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /> Let everyone enjoy this life, whether its plants or animals, flora or fauna, insects and you too will enjoy this life. Nature knows how to maintain this balance of survival and maintain <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/29/everybody-has-a-right-to-survive.htm" target="_self">the right of survival for everyone</a>. In other words &#8216;<em>Live and Let others Live</em>&#8216;.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">We cannot deny this right to anyone because 1) We are not above nature, if nature is supporting anything we cannot go against its wish completely. 2) Denying anything to anyone which is not directly supplied by us is not a positive approach, it is not our business to mind someone else business or survival. We can only control our own self, our own style.</span>
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /> Diversification Is Life</span>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">Life cannot be monotonous, predictable its diversified, uncertain and thus enjoyable. Things that happen aren&#8217;t always predetermined, even if an event is scheduled it can be canceled manually or due to circumstances, nevertheless we cannot predict this beforehand. It only becomes clear at the occasion. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">All these thinks play some role, help people with a positive mindset, who <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/38/hypnosis-for-positive-thinking.htm" target="_self">adopt positive approach</a> in life. These people don&#8217;t expect anything, they only take the right decision at the right time which we call a positive step, a positive approach.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">The diversified, self-contradicting nature of life, opens doors for survival of everyone, it gives a chance for survival of everything (even rumors, predictions, principles, assumptions, theories etc., etc.).Â  Some people start worrying as they cannot bear uncertainty while other <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/43/happiness-is-a-social-virtue.htm" target="_self">enjoy life and stay happy</a> as they know and understand that circumstance do not have a direct role, they are only temporary situations which often changes frequently.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /> What Are We Doing Today</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 130%;">Today we are trying to snatch this right from everything including nature, plants, animals and life. Today we are not living life we are just surviving, we have tried to accumulate most efficient things in life, we try to get most out of 24 hours in a day, yet we are moving away from peace, harmony, nature and life. Now a days we are discriminating things as good and bad, things which are considered bad are not allowed to exist, we think we know more then what nature does.<br /> </span>

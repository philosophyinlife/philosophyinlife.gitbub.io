We cannot deny the role and importance of money in our modern society, it is responsible for shaping every sphere of our life today, in a way which is unprecedented which has led me to believe that [money isn&#8217;t only important its omnipotent][1].

Money is involved in everything that is happening or taking place, its a form of energy which transforms itself from one form to another, from one hand to another, from one profession to another.

Today role of money has changed rapidly from being important to omnipotent, it is more or less source and destination of almost everything taking place in modern societies.

The way in which money is influencing our life is dangerous, which can lead to a blind society.

Most of our modern problems can be attributed to money and the way it is being used and misused. In the name of economic development we are somewhere getting too much influenced by money, it is creating a number of problems whether its environment problem like global warming, wild life or social problems, health problems. Each and every problem is somewhere connected to money.

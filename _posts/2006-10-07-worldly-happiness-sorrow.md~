> **One who is entangled in worldly pleasures and happiness, cannot know the bliss and joy of God**. If you do not desire unhappiness and sorrow, then do not become the enjoyer of worldly pleasures.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
  Worldly Happiness and Sorrow &#8211; Both are only Sorrow
</h2>

Worldly happiness and sorrow &#8211; both are only sorrow &#8211; &#8220;*Dukhmeva sarva vivekinaha*&#8221; (Yogadarshan 2:15). Both are like skin disease. The relief that one gets in scratching when the skin itches, that too is nothing but a disease.

Until that time that a man continues to seek pleasure from this world, till that time he remains immersed in the world, whether he is a ascetic, or a householder, or who ever he may be. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">As long as this world appears enjoyable and appealing, till that time he remains trapped in worldly affairs, even if he is an ascetic</span>. If the mind remains attracted and gravitates towards worldly affairs, name-fame is pleasing, then the world has won over us, and we have lost. The *man who is entangled in worldly pleasures and happiness, cannot know the bliss and joy of God*.

If he desires and longs for God, then he will attain that bliss and joy that even the greatest scholars, thinkers and philosophers did not experience.

**If you do not desire unhappiness and sorrow, then do not become the enjoyer of worldly pleasures**.

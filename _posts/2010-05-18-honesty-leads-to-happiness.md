title: Honesty leads to Happiness
author: Yogesh Bailwal
excerpt: Happiness can be easily achieved by a honest person then a dishonest person. There is a simply philosophy behind this which anyone can understand. We can be happy as well as honest in our present circumstances, only if we spare a little time to be self and understand the basic nature of human beings.

<span style="font-size: large;">Can honesty lead to happiness, will it help us in un-cluttering our problems and tensions. Well, yest&#8230; honesty means transparency and thus nothing to hold or left for worries.</span>

<span style="font-size: large;">Do you think honesty is related to success and happiness in life. Understanding a simple principle can lead to more comfortable life. </span>

<span style="font-size: large;">Our environment today is more polluted then it was a year ago, our food chain is more vulnerable today then it was some time back. </span>

<span style="font-size: large;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Today we are not actually enjoying life but we are only surviving, the physical environment is actually getting more and more polluted day by day which can be measured by our modern instruments but what about our mental environment our growing negative tendency, which has also deviated towards negative zone.</span></span>

<div style="font-family: Times,&amp; amp; text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;"><br /> </span>
</div>

<div style="font-family: Times,&amp; amp; text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">We cannot lead a calm life, a peaceful life because it is counter productive, our modern lifestyle has turned each one of us to a defensive mentality. </span>
</div>

<div style="font-family: Times,&amp; amp; text-align: justify;">
</div>

<div style="font-family: Times,&amp; amp; text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">We have to think before anything we do because nothing is natural, close to reality, water which was earlier a sign of life, a gift of nature is now a sign of pollutant illness and disease, we will not like to drink water directly from a natural source before processing or testing it.</span>

    <span style="font-size: large;">Walking in sunshine is no more safe, we have to use our own artificial protection to protect us from the natural gift sun rays. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: large;">Sun is the primary source of light, energy and food. It is responsible for protecting all forms of life on this planet.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: large;"> It is responsible for light, air and wind, takes care of bio-diversity on this planet. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: large;">Today, the same sun and its sunshine which is still the primary source of energy on this planet on one hand is also a threat or dangerous to our skin, our health on other. Why?</span>

  <span style="font-size: large;"><em>We have our-self destroyed peace on this planet, our happiness, we are no more truthful and honest to ourselves</em>, may be we have developed our mental powers, our ability to see and provide reasons/<a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/23/logic-and-philosophy.htm" target="_self">logical conclusion</a> for anything that happens or we attempt, but this frequent processing, frequent thinking has snatched our peace, <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/35/happiness-is-a-decision.htm" target="_self">our happiness</a>. We can cannot switch off our mind temporarily and then enjoy life.</span>

</div>

<div style="font-family: Times,&amp; amp; text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;"> Aristotle&#8217;s above quote tells us the whole story in few words, we have actually deviated from nature and now we are fighting back to protect ourselves, we know more believe in honesty because honesty is natural, unabridged edition which doesn&#8217;t need any alteration, any addition or subtraction. It is what it really was. If we are honest then we do not need any thinking we can only remember things and then replay the series.</span>

  <span style="font-size: large;">Truth fears no questions.  ~Unknown</span>
</div>

<div style="font-family: Times,&amp; amp; text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;"><strong>We have developed a fear due to existing negative environment around us, a symptom similar to dishonesty.</strong> We are today surviving by reading and learning advantages and benefits of doing this and using that. We have to take care of everything actively, we cannot close our eyes and be ourselves for even some moments. We fear that we will lag behind, we will loose something. </span>

<div style="font-family: Times,&amp; amp; text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-size: large;">This is not all, today <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we have developed a wrong concept about honesty</span>, we do not think of it as a natural tendency to enjoy happiness, we think it to be a difficult path, a way which can lead to unnecessary problems in our life. May be this is true today because our definition today has also shifted, now honesty is not a representation of natural outcomes (because nature is itself not natural anymore) but a presentation of the fact from our modern thinking. </span>

Honest is a tool to keep things simple and manageable.

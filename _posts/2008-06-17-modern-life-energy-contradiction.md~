<h2 style="text-align: center;">
  Modern Life : An Energetic Life
</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: large;">Life is energy, power, decreasing energy and power are a symbol of stagnation, a move towards lifelessness. Modern life is vibrant, filled with energy and power. Modern urban areas are more energetic and vibrant then rural area. Bigger cities are more vibrant and energetic then smaller cities. Rich have more energy and power then poor. </span><span style="font-size: large;">Todays energy, power and vibrancy has one more characteristic i.e. modern machines, comforting zones, latest equipments. Man enjoys the power and energy of these machines and equipments. He is a consumer of the service they provide and in order to get this he feed these machines with energy sources.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now when most of the countries on this planet are moving from under developed to developing, developing to developed, the requirement of energy for these machines have increased. Today it has increased to such a level that demand and supply have reached a critical point. Most of the energy resources are already destroyed or used. They are hardly enough to meet the ever growing demands in future.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In spite of this things are brighter as new discoveries with new necessities in mind will take care of energy requirement in future. Man can continue to enjoy the comforts and luxury of this new environment.
  </p>
  
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern Man : Tired of being Served, over Energized with Modern Comfort</span></span>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: large;">On one hand machines and equipments are replacing traditional tools (operated manually by man) and therefore need more and more energy for there jobs. On the other hand man is served, in every field of his everyday life, latest technology provides everything to keep him in a comfortable position at one place, a room corner. He can now save energy in every manual task, now most of his jobs are served by equipments which are either automatic or semi automatic. Although man isn&#8217;t satisfied with current level of comfort as it isn&#8217;t enough to meet his requirement of comfort and still there are a number of necessities which are urgent in nature.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unfortunately man still has all his senses working, his tongue still likes to have delicious dishes, mouth watering preparation. He loves to have more and more. This isn&#8217;t enough even other senses are in working condition and enjoy modernity. Now, there is only one odd thing here, his energy requirements have decreased and the energy he has stored is in excess of what he actually needs. This extra energy is causing all sort of discomfort and problems to him, even <a href="http://www.healthyganoderma.com/natural-health-care" target="_blank">health problems</a> and sometimes even life.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Modern science has the solution, now he can enjoy same delicious dishes with low calories or energy. This has solved the excess energy problem to some extent but there is another problem attached to it. Energy requirement of the man may have decreased but he still needs some vital ingredients in small quantity that were earlier available in his traditional foods in order to keep his body functional and healthy. Modern processed foods and the products from modern production techniques either don&#8217;t have those or doesn&#8217;t have it in optimum quantity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another addition to the problem is that sources of traditional food production are decreasing, fertile agriculture land is decreasing, natural sources of water are decreasing, fresh air is decreasing and this is the condition when most countries on the earth are yet to develop, yet to adopt modern lifestyle. Another contradiction is that energy sources that he provides to his gadgets, machines to keep them energetic, vibrant can&#8217;t be used by him.
  </p>
  
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern Life & Energy Contradiction</span></span>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: large;">All the discussion above point to <span style="font-weight: bold;">an energy contradiction in modern life</span>. Man wants to loose energy, machines want more and more energy. One point is that extra energy with man can&#8217;t be used by machines, another point is if man uses his extra energy to do some tasks then he won&#8217;t need the machines and the purpose of <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/16/modern-life-energy-contradiction.htm" target="_self">modern life and comfort</a> of modern science will be defeated.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    These two points make a inversely proportional relationship between energy requirement and use of the man and the machine. When one increases another decreases and when one decreases another increases.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Currently available solutions to man are doing some physical work everyday like exercise, jogging, walking etc. Keeping his tongue under control. Don&#8217;t you think these are contradictory and ridiculous, man is ready to jump like a monkey (even if he is not interested) but he isn&#8217;t ready to do work manually. The extra time he save with machines is actually used by man for his own destruction, watching TV, movies, clubs, shopping malls to mention some.
  </p>
  
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern Life & Energy Contradiction : Necessity of A Modern Scientific Solution</span></span>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: large;">Modern science urgently needs a solution to this <a href="http://www.philosophyinlife.info/modern-life-energy-contradiction/" target="_self">modern life and energy contradiction</a>. One solution in my mind which can be implemented scientifically with some more researches in virtual reality. Virtual reality can help satiate the senses of a man. Currently virtual reality works for eyes and ears but it can be extended for other sense too.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another ultimate obvious solution to this problem that I can currently think of is that human body is more a source of problem then a creative solution. It has created a number of problems like problem with body and health, problem with relationships, social issues, political issues and a number of other problems. Human body plays a significant role in all these problems.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: large;">Modern science has solution to almost all problems and tasks and with the invention of next generation of intelligent computers, every single task can be automated, no manual intervention will be required at all. Can&#8217;t we combine the benefits of virtual reality and intelligent computers to eliminate the problems associated with man. Can&#8217;t we simple eliminate the physical existence of man so that he can live in a virtual world and enjoy all comforts of modern science trouble free. I think this is possible with further developments and integration of virtual reality and next series of intelligent computers in fully automated modern world.</span>

  <p>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">A simple solution to modern life and energy contradiction</span> and all problems associated with man.

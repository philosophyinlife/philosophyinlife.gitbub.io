  : Shree Hari :
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Bhadrapad Shukla Sasthi, Vikram Samvat 2063, Mangalvar
</p>

Even a fraction of [God is infinite][1]. He remains ever infinite. God cannot be known even by the powers bestowed upon man by God Himself. God doesn&#8217;t know Himself completely, if He did, then how will He remain infinite?

> Whether Attribute-less, with Attributes, Formless and with Form, all joined together is God in entirety, having known which nothing remains to be known, because there is nothing else besides God.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
  God is Infinite, Incomprehensible
</h2>

Gita 11:16

<p style="text-align: center;">
  &#8220;<em>Anek baahudaravakranetra m, pasyaami tvaam sarvatonantaroopam</em><br /> <em> Naantam na madhyam na punastavaadim, pasyaami visvesvara visvaroopa</em>&#8220;
</p>

O Lord of all Universes ! I behold You, in endless forms on all sides, with numerous arms, bellies, faces and eyes. O Universal Form (Viswarupa), I see neither Your beginning, nor Your end.

Comments:

Even a fraction of God is infinite. Whether God is with form or formless, with attributes or without attributes, whether He is greater than great, or whether He is smaller than the smallest, He remains ever infinite.

Gita 11:17

<p style="text-align: center;">
  &#8220;<em>Kiritinam gadinam chakrinam che, tejoraashim sarvatoh diptimantam</em><br /> <em> pasyaami tvaam durniriksyam samanta, ddiptaanalaarkadyut imaprameyam</em>&#8220;
</p>

I see you wearing a diadem, holding a mace and discus, a mass of effulgence, shining all round having a brilliance like a blazing fire and like the sun, dazzling and boundless on all sides.

Comments:

Though Arjuna was blessed with the divine sight of God, yet Arjuna was not fully capable of seeing the cosmic form of God. It proves that God cannot be known even by the powers bestowed upon a man by God. Not just that, even God doesn&#8217;t know Himself completely, if He knew Himself, then how will He remain infinite?

Gita 11:18

<p style="text-align: center;">
  &#8220;<em>Tvamaksaram paramam veditavyam, tvamasya visvasya param nidhaanam</em><br /> <em> tvamavyayah saasvatadharmagopta a, sanaatanastam puruso mato me</em>&#8220;
</p>

I believe, that it is only You, that is worth knowing, the Imperishable, the Supreme Being; It is only You that is the Ultimate refuge of this Universe; It is only You that is the protector of *Eternal Dharma* (duties and righteousness) , and it is You alone, that is Eternal and Imperishable Being.

Comments:

Here &#8220;Twamaksaram paramam veditavyam&#8221; refers to One who is attribute-less and formless Brahma.

The expression &#8220;Tvamasy visvasya param nidhaanam&#8221; denotes God endowed with attributes and formless; and the expression &#8220;tvam sasvatadharmagopta&#8221; denotes God endowed with attributes and with form.

It means that One that is attribute-less and formless, One with attributes and formless and One with attributes and form &#8211; all these joined together, is the entire form of God, having know which nothing remains to be known. (Gita 7:2), because there is nothing else besides God.

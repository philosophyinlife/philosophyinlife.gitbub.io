Philosophy In Life & Happiness was originally hosted at Google&#8217;s blogspot site for more then 4 years now (it is still there at http://philosophyinlife.blogspot.com/. I wanted more freedom of expression, more ways to express myself and therefore I required an independent platform. I hope it will do good with WordPress and its powerful community.

This independence isn&#8217;t actually risk less, there are a number of security threats and technical problems which can not only make this blog inaccessible but can also result in loss of data and all those posts. Anyway I hope it will help to spread the real philosophy behind all philosophies. Life can have a number of meanings but we should not forget that life means live, a pleasing experience, something which is still visible in nature, in plants, animals. 

Rest of the About pages is a copy of the previous version that existed on blogspot blog.

This blog and its posts are quiet close to my heart. I am not a philosopher by profession or have had any formal education in philosophy. These are my personal thoughts and views on life which have evolved over time.

All the posts in this blog are actually a result of an effort to copy thoughts that erupt and then die out in moments. It isn&#8217;t always possible to give exact and right meaning in words to all those thoughts and there conclusion. Sometimes they even start distracting from the reality, sometimes they aren&#8217;t able to give a clear picture they only provide a frame without any picture.

Philosophy in life and Happiness isn&#8217;t here to serve any commercial purpose, all the ads and commercials that you find around the posts too have some philosophical significance :-

1. ) Money is somewhere related to our lives today, it also tries its best to shows its importance from time to time in one form or another. Today our self respect, worth can also be measured in terms of our financial worth and how much we are earning, it also represents our ego. Doing useless things and wasting time will not fetch any money or a good job. So, an ability to earn (may be little) does gives some worth to this blog and the posts it contains. They do give a meaning to its posts even if nobody likes or reads it. A WAY TO WIN STRUGGLE OF MIND AND EGO.

2.) Usually ( a large number of visitors) that reach this blog are actually looking for something else, they do not find the contents as per there expectation here. So, these ads serve a purpose, they show them more relevant options that are based on the keywords that led them to this blog. Advertisement give value to the blog on one hand and help visitors to reach there destination on another.

This blog actually depicts a positive thinking, a positive approach to life. Currently it doesn&#8217;t have much posts, as time and condition has always been a obstacle but once the posts reach a considerable number, covering every aspect of life (or every aspect of philosophy of happiness), they will be able to draw a clear picture of the philosophy that this blog is talking about.

In brief this blog is about happiness, peaceful life, helping nature to help us, enjoying life in every circumstance, understanding problems and how they play a positive role in our life, right of every individual to survive, global and universal society and much much more.

Posts on this blog are not regular but they do appear from time to time, this blog is a journey of my soul, it gives me great satisfaction and I hope to draw eternal bliss from it in future.

Be Happy and Enjoy life,

(after all its the only purpose of our being here)
